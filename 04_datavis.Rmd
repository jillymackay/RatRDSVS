## Data Visualisation {#datavis}

Data visualisation is one of the most important skills a scientst can learn, and being able to identify good and bad data visualisation will make you the life and soul of every party, and incredibly popular at all times.

In this chapter, we're not going to look at any R code. Instead we're going to think about what data visualisation means. 


### When charts go bad {#vis_bad}

Lets take a look at **Figure 4.1**. 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.cap="US State of Georgia, COVID-19 Deaths,\nSource: https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/05/18/1589795135000/When-axes-get-truly-evil/", fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/04_datavis/georgia_covid.jpg")

```

There is an [excellent article](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/05/18/1589795135000/When-axes-get-truly-evil/) from the Financial Times about this chart. I think this chart is a great example of why data visualisation is important. 

We use charts to communicate large amounts of data quickly and easily.

Often, in life, we are trying to communicate something important. We are often trying to persuade someone to do something, like give us more research money, or to make a change that we want to see. 

What message do you think **Figure 4.1** is trying to communicate? 

If you look at the x axis (the one that goes across the graph), what order are the dates in?


### Chart anatomy {#vis_anatomy}
#### The two-axes rule
Most charts will have two axes:

  * The **x axis** which goes **across the chart**
  
  * The **y axis** which goes **up the chart** (upp-**y**/down-**y** was how I used to remember it).
  

As in data science we are often interested in **does x affect y**, we usually put the **explanatory** variable on the x axis. We try to always have the thing that drives variation going across the chart, whereas the thing that responds to variation goes up and down the chart. (The response-**y** variable.)

You should always think about your axes - and they should be clear to the reader from the beginning. No messing with the order (see again **Figure 4.1**).

Unless you have a very good reason, I would always have two axes. That means if you're trying to put in a second Y axis, you are breaking the two-axes rule, and should re-evaluate your chart. If you're trying to make a pie-chart, you are breaking the two-axes rule, and should re-evaluate your chart. 

Follow the two-axes rule, and your life will be a lot easier. 

#### Why I hate pie charts
Pie charts are the worst visualisation in the world. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="The worst kind of chart describing proportion of people with type of pet (fictional data)", fig.align='center'}

pie_df <- data.frame(group = c("Cats", "Dogs", "Fish", "Birds", "Reptiles", "Rabbits"),
                     values = c(25,28, 20, 15 ,2,10))

pie_df  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y= values, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0)

```

Let's take **Figure 4.2** as an example. What proportion of people have a dog versus a cat. I'll wait for you to start puzzling through that question. 

It's very hard to distinguish between a pie slice that's 2/5ths versus a pie slice that's 2/7ths. Many people put labels on their pie charts, but if I need to read the label to understand the difference, why not just put the text in a table? 

Instead a bar chart shows use the exact ranking of this data and we can see how many more people have cats versus birds. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "A much better chart describing proportion of people with type of pet (fictional data)", fig.align='center'}


pie_df  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(group,-values), y= values, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", position = position_dodge2()) +
  labs(y = "N of People With Pet",
       x = "Type of pet") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```


#### Figure headings
Figure headings should be a clear description of what is in the chart. 

#### Legends
Like figure headings, legends should be informative and clear. They will always describe a categorical variable, and sometimes their job will be done by the x axis. 


#### Colours
The use of colours in charts is a curious thing. Colour can be very useful in a chart, but also very distracting. There's another [brilliant FT article on the use of colour to indicate gender in charts](https://www.ft.com/content/c4b7d8be-2eb0-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381) and all the ensuing complications. (University of Edinburgh folk can log in to the FT for free).


##### Advanced R users
If you have gotten really into R, or you really like pretty colours, I highly recommend checking out [Emil Hvitfeldt's well maintained repository](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) listing all the R colour palette packages out there. Personally I really like `nord`^[I like `nord` so much its the colour scheme for this book] and `LaCroixColoR` and `NineteenEightyR`. Much of my life is spent tweaking colours on charts.



### Bar charts {#vis_bar}
Bar charts are good for describing a continuous (numerical) variable by a categorical (grouping) variable. When you are describing a continuous variable by a categorical variable, you are usually describing the mean of that category, but it can also be the median, or other measures. For example:


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "Average height (cm) of Star Wars characters by gender"}


starwars  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = height)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary") +
  labs(x = "Gender presentation",
       y = "Height (cm)")

```

They can also be flipped around, particularly if the axis text is hard to read in one particular direction:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "Average height (cm) of Star Wars characters by species", fig.align='center'}


starwars  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(species, -height), y = height)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary") +
  labs(x = "Species",
       y = "Height (cm)") +
  coord_flip()

```



### Histograms {#vis_hist}
A histogram shows the relative frequency of a continuous variable. For example we can see the most common height of Star Wars characters, with 20 characters, is around 180cm:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "Histogram of height (cm) of Star Wars characters", fig.align='center'}


starwars  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  labs(x = "Height (cm)",
       y = "Count of characters")

```

### Scatterplots {#vis_scatter}
Scatterplots are good for showing the relationship between two continuous variables. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "Average height (cm) of Star Wars characters by weight (kg)", fig.align='center'}


starwars  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Weight (kg)",
       x = "Height (cm)")

```

But we can use other aspects, such as shape or colour, to add in a categorical variable:



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "Average height (cm) of Star Wars characters by weight (kg) and species", fig.align= 'center'}


starwars  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(y = "Weight (kg)",
       x = "Height (cm)") + 
  guides(col= guide_legend(nco = 3))

```


### Boxplots {#vis_box}

Boxplots are another way to examine a continuous variable by a categorical variable, but they give us a lot more information than a bar plot does. 

A boxplot shows you:

  * The **median** value (the thick bar in the middle)
  
  * The **first quartile** (the lowest part of the bar)
  
  * The **third quartile** (the highest part of the bar)
  
  * A **lower hinge** (the bottom thin line) which roughly equates to 95% of the data will not be below this value. 
  
  * An **upper hinge** (the top thin line) which roughy equates to 95% of the data will not be above this value. 
  
  * Any **outliers** (the dots) which are observations which lie outside of 95% of the data^[The hinges are actually calculated based on the `boxplot.stats` [function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.6.2/topics/boxplot.stats) which is a little more complicated than 95% of the data - but if you ever need to worry about this you have gone beyond what this book can teach you.]

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "Average height (cm) of Star Wars characters by gender", fig.align='center'}


starwars  |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = height)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Gender presentation",
       y = "Height (cm)")

```

### Infographics {#vis_infographic}

In our increasingly connected world, we are seeing more and more infographics. As they're less standardised, there can be more room for interpretation. For example;



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As an Indian woman, I can confirm that too much of my time is spent hiding behind a rock praying the terrifying gang of international giant ladies and their Latvian general don&#39;t find me <a href="https://t.co/sy9NHW9oTK">pic.twitter.com/sy9NHW9oTK</a></p>&mdash; Sabah Ibrahim (@reina_sabah) <a href="https://twitter.com/reina_sabah/status/1291509085855260672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


Infographics can be extremely powerful, particularly when trying to communicate on social media. Unfortunately, sometimes the design choices can make it harder to understand exactly what the analysis has done. Infographics can be as misleading as bad charts. 

In general, I would focus on chart visualisations over infographics, even for public engagement. When you are very confident with making clear and readable charts, then you can start to think about infographics.
