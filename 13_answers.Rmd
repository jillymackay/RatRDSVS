Here are the answers to [Creating Data](#ex_createdata)

### Changing mpg data

Changing one variable is pretty easy to do in `tidyverse`:

```{r  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

mpg2 <- mpg %>% 
  mutate(manufacturer = as.factor(manufacturer))

```

But what if we want to change all the character variables?

We can still use `mutate` like this:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

mpg2 <- mpg %>% 
  mutate(manufacturer = as.factor(manufacturer),
         model = as.factor(model),
         trans = as.factor(trans),
         drv = as.factor(drv),
         fl = as.factor(fl),
         class = as.factor(class))

```

Or we can use a slightly different command to apply the `as.factor` function across selected variables, predictably called `mutate_at()`


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

mpg2 <- mpg %>% 
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(c(manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class)),
            .funs = as.factor)

```


`mutate_at` becomes a very useful way of shortening your code, but can also be a little bit more difficult to remember. I very often have to look it up. But that's fine - looking up code is good :)



## Loading csv data answers {#ans_loadcsv}
Here's the answer to [how to change the name of a dataset from a csv file](#ex_loadcsv)

```{r eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

dat <- read.csv("~/data/ch2_planets.csv")

```



Here is a chunk of text to hide the next answer from you in case you're doing these answers sequentially. 






```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Using the Import Dataset wizard to load a xlsx file", fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/03_data/excel_open.gif")

```






## Loading excel data answers {#ans_loadexcel}
In this section I asked you to [load data from a different folder and have a short cut to stop us having to load `readxl` each time](#ex_loadexcel)


If the below code doesn't make sense to you - reach out to me! 
```{r eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

dat <- readxl::read_excel("data/ch2_planets.xlsx")

```






## ggplot answers {#ans_ggbox}

### Boxplot of highway miles per gallon versus class (mpg dataset) 

Here is one possible solution:


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

A prettier solution might be:



```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(class, -hwy), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs (x = "Car class",
        y = "Highway miles per gallon") +
  theme_classic()

```



### Histogram of city miles per gallon faceted by transmission type (mpg dataset) {#ans_gghist}

A possible solution:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


mpg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(facets = ~ trans)

```



## Proof of variance {#stats_proofvariance}


If we take our `coos` dataset again and create a new variable taking each value away from the mean:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

distances <- coos %>% 
  mutate(distances = mean(weight)-weight)

distances

```

And then we add all the distances together . . .


```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

round(sum(distances$distances), digits = 1)

```



## Tidy Unicorns {#ans_tidyunicorns}

We can tidy our Unicorn dataset with the `pivot_longer` command:

```{r eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

RadioTidy <- Radio %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(NoRadio:RadioDiscussion),
               names_to = "Radio",
               values_to = "DustYield")

```
